Project Name: Breakout Ball Game 

Description: This project involves creating a Breakout Ball game, inspired by the classic game developed in the 1970s. 

The goal is to use Java, particularly its AWT and Swing frameworks, to develop a functional and engaging game. 

This game serves as a learning platform to explore Java's capabilities in game development and inspire future developers.

Objective The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the versatility of Java in game development.

Java's rich collection of open-source material makes it an excellent choice for creating games like Breakout Ball. 

Through this project, we aim to utilize beginner-level Java concepts such as AWT, Swing, JFrame, JPanel, etc., 

to recreate a version of the widely popular Breakout game. 

This game is not intended to be a commercial success but rather a learning tool and a stepping stone for aspiring developers. 

Project Context Game Inspiration: Breakout, developed in the 1970s 

Gameplay Mechanics: The game features a layer of bricks at the top of the screen,
 
which players aim to destroy using a ball. The ball moves across the screen, bouncing off walls and bricks. 

The player controls a paddle at the bottom to keep the ball in play and prevent it from touching the screen's bottom. 

Objective: Break all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the paddle.
